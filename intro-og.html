        createClass - you are creating a blueprint for a new type
            of component, and that is a new type of element that i can
            render out to the DOM. i can render MyFirstComponent 15 times
            and get 15 divs with h1's inside. its a blueprint for stamping
            out MyFirstComponents.
        createElement - is 1 stamp. its creating 1 instance of that
            particular new element.

        components in React are nothing but functions - thats the mapping
        that you need to get into your head. a component, a tag, an element -
        everything is just a function call.
